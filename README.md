Nunaliit Atlas Framework (Nunaliit) is a system for creating interactive, data-driven web atlases supporting user
editing of documents and geometries, integrated multimedia, document relations, flexible data schemas, self-replication,
dynamic push updates to the browser for new objects, and online/offline tablet-based editing and syncing.

It has been created by a team at the [Geomatics and Cartographic Research Centre](http://gcrc.carleton.ca) at
Carleton University in Ottawa, Canada.

The [User Documentation](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/GCRC/nunaliit/master/nunaliit_guide.html)
describes the setup and use of Nunaliit.

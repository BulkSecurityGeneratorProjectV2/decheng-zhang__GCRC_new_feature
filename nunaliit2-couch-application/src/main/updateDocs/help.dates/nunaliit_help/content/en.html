<div class="n2help_content help_content_dates">
	<p>Dates can be expressed using one of the following formats:
	<ul>
	    <li>YYYY</li>
	    <li>YYYY-MM</li>
	    <li>YYYY-MM-DD</li>
	    <li>YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm</li>
	    <li>YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	
	<p>In Nunaliit, all dates are recorded as time intervals. If only
	a year is specified, then the recorded time interval is a period
	that starts from the first day of the year until the last day of
	the year. Dates recorded with a greater precision yield shorter
	time intervals.</p>
	
	<p>Time intervals that do not coincide with year or month boundary
	can be expressed as a duration between two dates. A duration is expressed 
	as:
	<pre>
		&lt;start-date&gt; / &lt;end-date&gt;
	</pre>
	</p>
	
	<p>If a duration is continuing until the present (e.g. employed since), then the
	duration can be entered using the following format:
	<pre>
		&lt;start-date&gt; / -
	</pre>
	</p>
